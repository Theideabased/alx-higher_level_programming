In this directory i have written examples of code with different doctest.

I well be writing code on how to test code in different ways. 
There are several process of testing a code in software developnment cycle,
some of them are
 * ## Functional testing ##
	 * Unit testing
	 * Integration testing
	 * system testing
	 * Regression testing
	 * Acceptance testing
	 * Alpha testing
	 * Beta testing
 * ## Non-functional testing ##
	* performance testing
	* Usability testing
	* load testing
	* stress testing
	* security testing
	* portability testing

This is to mention a few. I will be writing some simple codes and writing the documentation for testing.
* Enjoy *
