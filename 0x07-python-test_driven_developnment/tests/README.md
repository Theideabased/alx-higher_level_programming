# Testing code #
In this directory i have written examples of code with different doctest.

I will be writing code on how to test code in different ways. 
There are several process of testing a code in software developnment cycle,
some of them are
 * ## Functional testing ##
	 * Unit testing
	 * Integration testing
	 * system testing
	 * Regression testing
	 * Acceptance testing
	 * Alpha testing
	 * Beta testing
 * ## Non-functional testing ##
	* performance testing
	* Usability testing
	* load testing
	* stress testing
	* security testing
	* portability testing

This is to mention a few. I will be writing some simple codes and writing the documentation for testing
Also to test we need planing, this are this that will be in a test plan:
Introduction to the Test Plan document

* Assumptions while testing the application
* List of test cases included in testing the application
* List of features to be tested
* What sort of approach to use while testing the software
* List of deliverables that need to be tested
* The resources allocated for testing the application
* Any risks involved during the testing process
* A schedule of tasks and milestones to be achieve 

Furthermore, test cases are written to keep track of the testing coverage of a software. Generally, there are no formal templates that can be used during test case writing. However, the following components are always available and included in every test case:

* Test case ID
* Product module
* Product version
* Revision history
* Purpose
* Assumptions
* Pre-conditions
* Steps
* Expected outcome
* Actual outcome
* Post-conditions 

Any software that is not tested frequently and thoroughly will end up to be a disaster. see as i
test my codes and document them the right way
