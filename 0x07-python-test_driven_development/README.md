This directory will teach you different way of testing your python code
Testing a code is veey important because it help you check all the functionalities you have written before you deploy the code

we will ne using two different way to test our code
 * docstring
 * import doctest

Docstring: this was you create a .txt file that will be like a 
sample to the code you have written and you see the error using 
tgis code on your prompt "python -m doctest -v file.txt" 

Import Doctest: in this case you will import module into your python code that will
check your documentstion written in your function to test thr function
